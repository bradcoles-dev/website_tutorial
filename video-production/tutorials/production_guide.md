   - "Matthew" or "Australian English Male"
   - Good quality, slightly less natural than ElevenLabs
   - Costs: ~$19-39/month

3. **Murf.ai**
   - Multiple Australian accent options
   - Good for professional narration
   - Costs: ~$19-29/month

## 🎙️ Recording Your Own Voiceover

### Equipment Setup

**Minimum**:
- Decent USB microphone (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica AT2020)
- Quiet room with soft furnishings
- Pop filter

**Professional**:
- XLR microphone + audio interface
- Treated recording space
- Professional DAW

### Recording Tips

1. **Microphone Position**: 6-8 inches from your mouth, slightly off-axis
2. **Recording Level**: Peak around -12dB to -6dB
3. **Room Treatment**: Record in a carpeted room with soft furnishings, or use blankets to dampen echo
4. **Multiple Takes**: Record the entire script, then do pickup takes for sections you're not happy with
5. **Consistency**: Record everything in one session if possible for consistent tone

### Post-Processing Audio

1. **Remove Background Noise**: Use noise reduction (Audacity has this built-in)
2. **EQ**: Cut frequencies below 80Hz (rumble), slight boost around 3-5kHz (clarity)
3. **Compression**: Gentle compression (ratio 3:1 to 4:1) to even out volume
4. **Normalization**: Normalize to -3dB to -1dB for final output
5. **De-essing**: If needed, reduce harsh 's' sounds

## 🎬 Editing Workflow

### Suggested Edit Order

1. **Assembly Edit**:
   - Import all footage
   - Lay out voiceover on timeline
   - Add corresponding visuals
   - Rough cut without worrying about perfection

2. **Refinement**:
   - Trim fat (remove pauses, "umm"s)
   - Add transitions (keep subtle - cuts or dissolves)
   - Insert B-roll over talking head sections
   - Add text overlays for key points

3. **Polish**:
   - Color correction/grading
   - Add background music
   - Audio mixing and balancing
   - Add intro/outro graphics

4. **Review**:
   - Watch start to finish
   - Check audio levels (consistent)
   - Verify all text overlays are readable
   - Test on mobile device

### Common Editing Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Too many transitions (keep it simple)
- ❌ Music too loud (should be background)
- ❌ Inconsistent audio levels
- ❌ Text overlays too fast/small
- ❌ Overuse of zoom effects
- ❌ Dead space/awkward pauses
