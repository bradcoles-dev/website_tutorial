## 🎬 Production Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Don't Rush**: Quality > Speed
2. **Multiple Takes**: Record each section 2-3 times
3. **Test First**: Do 30-second test before full recording
4. **Save Often**: Auto-save every 5 minutes in editor
5. **Back Up**: Keep copies of everything
6. **Take Breaks**: Edit with fresh eyes
7. **Get Feedback**: Show rough cut to friend/colleague
8. **Iterate**: Your first video won't be perfect (and that's OK!)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ Recording at wrong resolution
❌ Not checking audio levels
❌ Forgetting to save project files
❌ Not testing before full recording
❌ Skipping the review phase
❌ Uploading without metadata
❌ Creating misleading thumbnail
